You can navigate through the dashboard using the menu on the right. 
Each chart shows the most important trends, figures and numbers.

## GOAL

The purpose of a dashboard is to review the most important KPI’s and results on the one page. 
Dashboard is an interactive way to see how the logistics process performs.

## RESULT
- The dashboard gives on-time delivery performance overview and current status of shipments in transit. Some filters can be applied to choose dates, regions or carriers to review the performance for the past period, provide root cause analysis and find weaknesses in process.
- Monitoring of current order status allows to prevent shipments delay in advance. Inadequate carrier status can be selected and delivery problems might be solved on time.
- Timeline on the charts can be group by weeks, months, years or region. The drill-dawn clearly groups information ranging from the big picture down to individual case.
- By using the dashboard, you will discover the right insights in an easy way. You can apply filters yourself and review different graphs. By immediately having the right information available, correct decisions can be made.
